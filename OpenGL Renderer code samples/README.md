# OpenGL renderer code samples
These files are taken from my custom OpenGL renderer that I originally made for a class at DigiPen.  <br />
While not every header and required file is included here, there is enough to get a sense of my code style. <br />
Feel free to check out the rest of the project here to see it in action: https://github.com/MarkKouris/OpenGLRenderer  <br />
