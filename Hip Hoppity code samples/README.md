# Hip Hoppity code samples
These files are taken from the custom C++ engine I worked on at DigiPen for the game Hip Hoppity.  <br />
While not every header and required file is included here, there is enough to get a sense of my code style. <br />
You can demo the finished product on my website: https://www.markkouris.com/  <br />
